# Session resource

After an application has successfully identified itself and the provided identity token was valid, it may request the
creation of a new session. Only session tokens may be used to access privileged resources, thus the existence of a
session is required for most interactions with the API.

> [!NOTE]
> A session does not strictly comply with the HTTP semantics standard, as it is not handled as a resource internally
> that could be exposed via API endpoints. Furthermore, to minimize state and maximize security, a session resource
> cannot be accessed externally after it has been created. The only exception to this is the
> [logout](#logout-delete-session-br--sessionssubjectidsessionid) endpoint.

## Session object

See [tokens](../Authentication.md) for more information on what sessions and subjects are and what role they occupy in
authentication and authorization.
